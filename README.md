    * Google Earth Engine will be used to retrieve elevation data and render topographic map
    * D3 will be used to create the profile line graph

## :small_blue_diamond:Functionality & MVPs:small_blue_diamond:
### Friday Afternoon & Weekend
* be able to access API from VS Code
* retrieve topographic map for a location
* get topographic map on browser
* retrieve elevation data for a location
* retrieve elevation data for points from path that user drew

### Monday
*figure out how to graph the elevation data for the drawn path as a profile
    *will need to auto generate x & y axes based on data
        *x-axis: holds elevation and will need to scale & round based on max elevation
        *y-axis: holds distance and will need to scale & round based on path length

### Tuesday 
*create three preset topographic maps that user can choose from if they donâ€™t enter a custom location
*focus on UI experience and flow
    *for example, could I have a demo preset that auto draws like a gif?
*start basic styling
